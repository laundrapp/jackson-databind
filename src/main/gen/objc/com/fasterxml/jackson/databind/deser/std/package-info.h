/*!
 @brief Contains public standard implementations of abstraction that
  Jackson uses.This means that they are not merely implementation
  details, but part of semi-public interface where project
  tries to maintain backwards compatibility at higher level
  than for 'impl' types (although less so than with fully
  public interfaces).
 <p>
  Note that since this package was only added relatively late
  in development cycle, not all classes that belong here are
  included. Plan is to move more classes over time.
