/*!
 @brief Contains extended support for "external" packages: things that
 may or may not be present in runtime environment, but that are
 commonly enough used so that explicit support can be added.
 <p>
 Currently supported extensions include:
 <ul>
  <li>Support for Java 1.5 core XML datatypes: the reason these are
 considered "external" is that some platforms that claim to be 1.5 conformant
 are only partially so (Google Android, GAE) and do not included these
  types.
   </li>
  <li>Joda time. This package has superior date/time handling functionality,
 and is thus supported. However, to minimize forced dependencies this
 support is added as extension so that Joda is not needed by Jackson
 itself: but if it is present, its core types are supported to some
 degree
   </li>
 </ul>
