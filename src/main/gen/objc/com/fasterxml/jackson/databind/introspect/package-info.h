/*!
 @brief Functionality needed for Bean introspection, required for detecting
  accessors and mutators for Beans, as well as locating and handling
  method annotations.
 <p>
  Beyond collecting annotations, additional "method annotation inheritance"
  is also supported: whereas regular JDK classes do not add annotations
  from overridden methods in any situation. But code in this package does.
  Similarly class-annotations are inherited properly from interfaces, in
  addition to abstract and concrete classes.
